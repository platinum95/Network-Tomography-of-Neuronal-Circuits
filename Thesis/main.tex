\chapter*{Abstract}

With the proposal of numerous brain-machine interfaces offering data measurement
of cortical information through minimally-invasive means comes the need for a better
understanding of the circuit-level characteristics of these neuronal systems. These
devices allow data access at a level that can bridge the gap between biological
neuronal analysis and classical communication theory that has been developed for
and applied to man-made network systems.\\
\par
In this investigation we study the application of classical communication theory  in the
biological domain, investigating how network tomography could be
achieved with cortical neuronal circuits. This work involves the simulation of
various neuronal circuits, extraction of the simulated data, and the analysis of this data to develop a
classifying model to infer internal network characteristics based on the measured
endpoint data. Through the processing of the observed data into probabilistic models, we investigate
the use of information theory in cell-to-cell links, and find limitations in the application of
digital mutual information analysis in the biological domain. We investigate the use of simple cross-correlation methods for estimating the synaptic delay in a neuronal circuit, achieving a correlative R-squared score of 0.55.
We also separately train a number of classifiers to identify
the specific cell type (and sub-group types) from input-output voltage measurements, achieving accuracies of up to 70\%.\\
This research can help to advance the next generation of brain-machine interfaces by improving our current understanding of these circuits and the constraints that may come with the application of existing telecommunicative theories in this biological domain.
