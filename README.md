# Network Tomography of Neuronal Circuits
Simulation, supporting framework, analysis, and writeup files for the research into the network tomography of cortical neuronal molecular communication systems.

## Layout
*Data Analysis*
This folder holds the MATLAB source files used in the analysis of the data pruduced by the neural simulations.
More details contained within.

*Neurpy*
This is a submodule (link to another repository) containing the Python code for the constructed supporting library which helps with the generation, creation and simulating of sets of neuronal circuits.
More details in there too.

*Thesis*
This folder has the tex files (and compiled PDF) of the full Thesis writeup, along with diagrams and such.
